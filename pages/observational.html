                            <p>For this portion of your portfolio, you are required to submit detailed hand-drawn sketches focusing on the human hand engaged in various activities. This exercise is designed to demonstrate your ability to capture complex forms, intricate details, and dynamic actions using simple lines and structure, and form.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

                                <li><strong>Actions:</strong> Each sketch should depict a hand performing different actions, such as grasping a cup, pointing, holding a pen, or manipulating small objects. Aim for a variety of poses to showcase your versatility.</li>
                                <li><strong>Technique:</strong> You may use traditional mediums, such as pencil or pen and ink, or digital tools in the creation of these sketches. Choose the medium that best suits your style and enhances the details in your drawings.</li>
                                <li><strong>Detail and Accuracy:</strong> Focus on accurately depicting the anatomy of the hand, the gesture, form, and the interaction of the hand holding or working with various objects. Consider the play of light and shadow to enhance the three-dimensional feel of the hand.</li>
                                <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Each sketch should be clean and clearly presented. Include minimal background elements to ensure the main focus remains on the hand itself.</li>

                                <li><strong>Study Real Hands:</strong> Observe and sketch from real-life situations as much as possible. Avoid using photographs as your only reference to ensure that your work captures the dynamic nature of real movements and interactions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Showcase Creativity:</strong> While accuracy is crucial, also show your creative approach. For instance, you might sketch a hand interacting with an unusual object or in a creative pose that tells a story.</li>
